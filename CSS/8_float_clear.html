            <h3>Fruits</h3>
            <p id="fruitpara" class="para">Fruits are nature's colorful, nutrient-rich gifts, bursting with flavor and
                health benefits. They come in various shapes, sizes, and textures, from juicy berries to tropical
                delights like mangoes and pineapples. Packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, fruits play a
                vital role in a balanced diet, supporting immune function, digestion, and heart health. Their natural
                sweetness makes them a perfect snack or addition to meals, encouraging healthier eating habits while
                providing hydration and energy. Enjoying a diverse range of fruits can enhance overall well-being and
                introduce exciting tastes to our plates.</p>

        <div id="vegetable" class="item">
            <h3>Vegetables</h3>
            <p id="vegetablepara" class="para">Vegetables are essential components of a healthy diet, offering a wide
                array of flavors, textures, and colors. Rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, they contribute to
                overall health by supporting digestion, reducing the risk of chronic diseases, and enhancing immune
                function. From leafy greens like spinach and kale to vibrant peppers and root vegetables like carrots
                and beets, each type brings unique nutrients and benefits. Incorporating a variety of vegetables into
                meals not only boosts nutritional value but also adds depth and creativity to cooking, making healthy
                eating both enjoyable and delicious.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="seasonal" class="item">
            <h3>Seasonal fruits and vegetables</h3>
            <p id="seasonalpara" class="para">Seasonal fruits and vegetables offer the freshest flavors and highest
                nutritional value, as they are harvested at their peak ripeness. Eating in sync with the seasons not
                only enhances taste but also supports local agriculture and reduces environmental impact. For instance,
                spring brings tender asparagus and sweet strawberries, while summer offers juicy peaches and vibrant
                tomatoes. Autumn is the time for crisp apples and hearty squash, and winter features citrus fruits and
                root vegetables. Embracing seasonal produce can inspire culinary creativity, making each meal a
                celebration of nature's bounty throughout the year.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="imported" class="item">
            <h3>Imported fruits and vegetables</h3>
            <p id="importedpara" class="para">Imported fruits and vegetables expand our culinary options by bringing
                diverse flavors and textures from around the globe. These products allow consumers to enjoy exotic
                varieties, such as tropical mangoes, avocados, and kiwi, regardless of the local growing season. While
                they can enhance diets with new tastes and nutrients, importing often involves long transportation
                times, which can impact freshness and environmental sustainability. Itâ€™s important to balance the
                enjoyment of imported produce with an appreciation for local seasonal options, fostering a diet that
                supports both global diversity and local agriculture.</p>
