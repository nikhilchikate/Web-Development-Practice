            browser to understand that it is an HTML document</li>
        <li>html lang= “en” - It is the opening part of the HTML tag that tells us the language of the document is in
            English.</li>
        <li>Head contains all the meta-tags in it which is used to describe the contents of a website. Meta means
            providing information about information. Therefore, meta tags are used to define the keywords and
            descriptions on our website. Head also contains the title of the website and all the external files like CSS
            and JavaScript that we link to it.</li>
        <li>Body contains all the contents of the webpage in it. However, in the beginning, our website may look a
            little uglier but after including stylesheets it will start looking attractive. </li>
